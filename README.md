# DASHBOT

There are two goals of this project. The first one being to create a dashboard
with personalised information. I wanna try to implement the following business
logic:

- scrape the web for news
- use public apis for job posts

This way I wanna be able to track certain topics and display them on the
dashboard. The second goal is to also use the backend from the dashboards and
integrate them as "tools" or "connectors" in ChatGPT.

## Stack

I want to deepen my knowledge in important AI Engineering skills.
Thus I want to implement the following stack:

- Python FastAPI docker container
- Jinja with HTMX
- AWS EC2: host container
- AWS RDS AURORA: scalable database
- AWS LAMBDA: nightly sync of news and job posts + llm analysis of them
